Assignments for SFWR ENG 3GC3 (Computer Graphics), created using OpenGL, GLUT, and C++.

### A1: Paint and Conway's Game of Life
A paint program that uses bresenham's line drawing algorithm to draw lines and shapes.  
*Learned about:* the basics of 2D OpenGL/GLUT.  
*Features:* colour selection, colour randomization, point drawing, line drawing, square drawing, circle drawing.  

AND

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life.   
*Learned about:* animation and double-buffering.  
*Features:* "world" randomization, "world" reset, pause/play, adjustable speed, cell-by-cell editing, pattern insertion (glider, blinker, etc.)

### A2: Terrain Generator
A random terrain generator that uses the "circles" algorithm.  
*Learned about:* the basics of 3D OpenGL/GLUT, drawing using vertices and polygons, height-maps, computing vertex normals.  
*Features:* adjustable lighting, movable camera, mesh-mode, 2D map, terrain editing through 2D map.

### A3: 3D Modeller
A basic 3D modeller that utilizes a scene-graph and ray-picking.  
*Learned about:* scene graphs, matrix transformation stack, mouse rays, the slab method.  
*Features:* adding primitive objects, deleting objects, scene reset, translation, rotation, scaling, changeable materials, adjustable lighting.
