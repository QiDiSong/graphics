Assignments for SFWR ENG 3GC3 (Computer Graphics), created using OpenGL, GLUT, and C++.

## A1
A paint program that uses bresenham's line drawing algorithm to draw lines and shapes.
Learned about: the basics of OpenGL/GLUT.
Features: colour selection, colour randomization, point drawing, line drawing, square drawing, circle drawing.

AND

An implementation of Conway's Game of Life.
Learned about: animation and double-buffering.
Features: "world" randomization, "world" reset, pause/play, adjustable speed, cell-by-cell editing, pattern insertion (glider, blinker, etc.)

## A2
A random terrain generator that uses the "circles" algorithm.
Learned about: drawing using vertices and polygons, height-maps, computing vertex normals.
Features: adjustable lighting, movable camera, mesh-mode, 2D map, terrain editing through 2D map.

## A3
A basic 3D modeller that utilizes a scene-graph and ray-picking.
Learned about: scene graphs, matrix transformation stack, the slab method.
Features: adding primitive objects, deleting objects, scene reset, translation, rotation, scaling, changeable materials, adjustable lighting.
